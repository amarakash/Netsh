Open chrome and goto google drive.
Create a folder and put your hash_file_name.hc22000

Create a new notebook, select a GPU as hardware accelerator 
and mount google drive.
Go to the desired folder 
using cd content/drive/Mydrive/folderName/
Then install hashcat and use it.




#install hashcat and crunch first
#use ! Before every command on colab otherwise 
colab will treat a command as python command

!apt install crunch
!apt install hashcat




#.cap to .hc22000
hcxpcapngtool -o output_file_name.hc22000 file_name.cap



#hashcat command for cracking
!hashcat -m 22000 hash.hc22000 rockyou.txt

#use the following command for showing auto status
#add -d 1 for using device one, -d 1 2 3 for using devices 1-3, -w 4 or -w 3 for best speed 
!hashcat -m 22000 <hash or hashfile> <wordlist> --status --status-timer 10



#show devices(GPU or CPU)
hashcat -I



#test cracking speed
!hashcat -b



#crunch + hashcat
#crunch will generate password as input for hashcat( '|' this symbol is called piping )

!crunch 8 8 0123456789 | hashcat -m 22000 n2307.hc22000




#crunch command, @ means variable, "abcde" is fixed
crunch 8 8 123 -t abcde@@@ -o output_fileName.txt
